# PrettyRecon-cli
PrettyRecon-cli is an unofficial cli client for [PrettyRecon](https://prettyrecon.com/).

This tool can be used to trigger various tasks on prettyrecon as well as fetch output of those tasks/scans.

As PrettyRecon currently does not have any api feature available, prettyrecon-cli uses email and password for authentication. None of these are saved or shared anywhere other than your computer where it is running.
